# MPI Matrix Multiplication on Scayle Supercomputer

## Description
This project implements matrix multiplication in C using MPI (Message Passing Interface) to achieve parallelism. The matrix multiplication was executed on the **Scayle** supercomputer as part of a distributed computing assignment.
This project was completed during the third year of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, for the subject **Parallel Architectures**.


## Purpose
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how matrix operations can be efficiently parallelized using MPI on a high-performance computing environment.

## Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- MPI (Message Passing Interface)
- Scayle Supercomputer
